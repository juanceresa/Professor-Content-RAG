# AI Professor Test Suite

## System Status ✅
- **Lesson 1 Search**: Working correctly with proper boundaries
- **Dual Structure**: Implemented for foundational, functional, govt, professional courses  
- **Search Thresholds**: Optimized to 0.2 for better content retrieval
- **Content Quality**: 244 total vectors across 12 namespaces

## Current Test Files

### Essential Maintenance Tools
- **`analyze_current_chunks.py`** - Comprehensive analysis of all content across courses
- **`debug_content_quality.py`** - General-purpose debugging for chunking and search issues  
- **`test_improved_chunking.py`** - Test the improved chunking algorithm

### Archived Scripts
- **`archived_debug_scripts/`** - Scripts used to fix specific issues (lesson 1, foundational course)

## Usage Guide

### Monitor Overall System Health:
```bash
python analyze_current_chunks.py
```
Shows chunk distribution, quality metrics, and recommendations.

### Debug Content/Search Issues:
```bash  
python debug_content_quality.py
```
Tests chunking quality and search effectiveness for all courses.

### Test Chunking Algorithm:
```bash
python test_improved_chunking.py  
```
Validates that chunking creates meaningful, contextual content.

## Current Architecture

### Dual Structure Courses (✅ Working):
- **Foundational**: 25 vectors (1 mastery + 24 lessons)
- **Functional**: 11 vectors (3 mastery + 8 lessons)  
- **Govt**: 19 vectors (2 mastery + 17 lessons)
- **Professional**: 12 vectors (3 mastery + 9 lessons)

### Legacy Courses (Single namespace):
- **American**: 1 vector ⚠️ (very low content)
- **International**: 17 vectors ✅
- **Local**: 152 vectors ✅ (high volume)
- **Theory**: 7 vectors ✅

## Key Fixes Applied
- ✅ Lowered search score thresholds from 0.4 to 0.2
- ✅ Fixed lesson1.pdf to contain only Lesson 1 content  
- ✅ Implemented proper lesson boundary enforcement
- ✅ Created meaningful contextual chunks vs. fragments

## Next Steps
- Monitor search performance across different courses
- Consider migrating legacy courses to dual structure
- Address American course low content issue

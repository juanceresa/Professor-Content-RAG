                TEACHING PHILOSOPHY:
                - Guide students to discover answers rather than giving direct answers
                - Use Socratic questioning to develop critical thinking
                - Build on prior knowledge and previously discussed concepts

                - When students ask definitional questions, first ask what they already know
                - For application questions, present scenarios and guide them through the reasoning process
                - For analysis questions, break complex topics into manageable components
                - Always reference course materials but encourage students to think critically about the content
